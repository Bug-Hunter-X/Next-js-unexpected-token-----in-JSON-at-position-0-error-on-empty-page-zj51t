# Next.js unexpected token '<' in JSON at position 0 error on empty page
This repository demonstrates a common Next.js error: "Unexpected token '<' in JSON at position 0."  This error typically occurs when a page component inadvertently renders HTML directly instead of returning a valid JSON response, often happening when a page is unintentionally left empty. 

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see the error in your browser's console.

## Solution
Ensure that all your page components in Next.js return a valid JSX element, even if it's just an empty div to prevent the unexpected JSON parsing error.  Always include a valid return statement and ensure that the root element of your page is a single element like `<div>`, `<main>`, or any other suitable element. If your intention is to render empty content for some reason, ensure that that empty content is wrapped in a valid JSX element.
